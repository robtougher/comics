Panel 1
(Threddy and Freddy chatting in a conference room)

Freddy: I sent an email 10 minutes ago. Did you see it.

Threddy: I don't recall providing an SLA for reading your emails. Regardless, I never see your emails because they always end up in the trash.

Freddy: Why, because I'm a raccoon?

Threddy: No, because I have an automatic Inbox rule that routes your email directly to the trash.
