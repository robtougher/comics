Panel 1
(Threddy and Freddy chatting in a treehouse)

Freddy: Another employee left the team this week. I don't understand why folks are leaving - I've tried free t-shirt, free drinks, morale video meetings, plaques. Nothing's working.

Threddy: Have you tried paying them more?

Freddy: Nah that'll never work.
