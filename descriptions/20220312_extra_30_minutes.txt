[PANEL 1 - Sam and Threddy standing in the lobby. Sam is standing on a large table in front of the couch.]

Sam: Now that we've switched to hybrid work, I add 30 minutes to the beginning of each meeting.

Threddy: Why's that?

Sam: So that folks on campus can wander around and search for a quiet room to join the call from.
