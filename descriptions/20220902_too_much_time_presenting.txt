Panel 1
(Sam and Threddy chatting outside)

Threddy: Lately we've been spending a lot of time in management meetings, presenting our engineering progress. I'm worried we're spending too much time *presenting* and not enough time *working*.

Sam: Please schedule a meeting to discuss your concerns.

Threddy: You're not helping.
