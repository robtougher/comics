[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy chatting in an outside cafe.]

Freddy: Hypothetically speaking...if I laid off 80% of the Blepster staff, could we still run the service?

Threddy: Probably not.

Freddy: What *could* I get with only 20% of our staff?

Threddy: A shared Word document that all users have full access to. We could name it "Blepster.docx".
