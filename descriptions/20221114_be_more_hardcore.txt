[PANEL 1 - Freddy and Threddy chatting in a cafe.]

Freddy: I want to be the most knowledgeable subject matter expert in the company.

Threddy: The company already has experts. The only way that would happen is if you fired everyone.

Freddy: Wait can I do that.

Threddy: No. Look at how well it's working out for Twitter.

Freddy: Maybe he needs to be more hardcore.

Threddy: Still no.
