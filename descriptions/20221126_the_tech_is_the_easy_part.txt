[PANEL 1 - Sam and Threddy chatting in an office. Sam is standing on the stairs.]

Threddy: I set up a Mastodon server and I was unprepared for how difficult it would be.

Sam: Which technology is the most difficult?

Threddy: The tech is the easy part. It's the *moderation* that's difficult. People can't just be cool for like two minutes.
