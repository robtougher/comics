Panel 1
(Threddy and Freddy chatting)

Freddy: After the Blepster layoffs, we have a new cost-conscious motto: "do more with less".


Panel 2
(closeup on Threddy, Freddy is off-panel)

Threddy: How about we start by doing more *empathy* with less *greed*. And more *communication* with less *ambiguity*.

Freddy: That's not what I meant.
