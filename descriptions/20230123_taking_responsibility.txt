[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy chatting in the office.]

Threddy: In the Blepster layoff email, you mention "taking responsibility". What does that mean exactly?


[PANEL 2]

Freddy: It means I take responsibility.

Threddy: Can you be more specific.


[PANEL 3 - closeup on Freddy]

Freddy: The responsibility. It is taken by me. Not taken by others. I take it.


[PANEL 4 - zoom out to both characters.]

Threddy: It doesn't mean anything, does it?

Freddy: No.
