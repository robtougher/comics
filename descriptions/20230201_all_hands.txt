Threddy: I'm disappointed about the all-hands meeting.


[PANEL 2 - closeup on Threddy]

Threddy: I hoped we would discuss layoffs, but it was just useless jargon like "leaning in" and "tech intensity".

Sam: Look on the bright side.
Threddy: What's that.


[PANEL 4 - closeup on Sam, holding Jargon Jar, with money in hand]
