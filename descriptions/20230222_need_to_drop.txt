[PANEL 1 - Freddy holding a sign that says n2d. Threddy facing him.]

Freddy: Check out my sign.

Threddy: What's that.


[PANEL 2 - closeup on Freddy]

Freddy: It stands for "need to drop". People type that acronym in the chat of a remote meeting when they need to leave.


[PANEL 3 - both characters visible]

Threddy: Why did you make a sign. Can't you just type it in the chat.

Freddy: I use it in real life when a conversation is boring.


[PANEL 4 - Freddy walking away, holding sign and waving it]

Threddy: I'm not sure what you mean. Wait where are you going.
