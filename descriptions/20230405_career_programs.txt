[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy chatting outside. They are standing in grass, with mountains in the background.]

Freddy: "During the next all-hands meeting I will be announcing new career programs."

Threddy: "Great! When are you implementing them?"

Freddy: "Never. I'm just announcing them to boost employee poll results."
