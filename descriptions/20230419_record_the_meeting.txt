[PANEL 1 - Freddy and Threddy chatting in the office. Freddy is walking away.]

Freddy: I can't attend today's meeting. Can you record?

Threddy: Sure. Will you watch afterwards?

Freddy: Probably not.

Threddy: Then why record?

Freddy: Have a growth mindset, Threddy.

Threddy: What does that even mean.
