[PANEL 1 - Freddy and Threddy chatting in the office.]

Threddy: When you first created Blepster, it was missing so many features. No videos, no gifs, no password changes, no multi-factor authâ€¦

Freddy: Ok, I get it. What's your point.

Threddy: With missing features, how did it still become so popular?

Freddy: People were having fun.
