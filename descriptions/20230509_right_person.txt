[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy chatting in the office.]

Threddy: I don't think I'm the right person for this project.

Freddy: Why?

Threddy: I don't understand the vision, I lack passion for the subject, I have no experience with it, etc.

Freddy: What can I do to help you move the project along?

Threddy: You can start by assigning it to someone else.
