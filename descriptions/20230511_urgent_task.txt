[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy chatting in the office.]

Freddy: I have an urgent task for you today.

Threddy: Is it more urgent than the urgent task you gave me yesterday? 
I'm still working on that.

Freddy: Same urgency. Please complete everything. Urgently.

Threddy: If everything is urgent, nothing is urgent.

Freddy: I will not be deterred by common sense.
