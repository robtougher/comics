[PANEL 1 - Threddy, Sam, and Freddy chatting in the office.]

Freddy: Congratulations on a great year. Despite our success, unfortunately we will not be raising salaries for employees this year.

Threddy: Wait what. But we worked so hard.

Freddy: I blame economic headwinds.

Sam: At least it's not more layoffs.

Freddy: Ha ha! I know, right?! Totall.

(There will be more layoffsâ€¦)
