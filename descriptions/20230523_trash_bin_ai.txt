[PANEL 1 - Freddy and Threddy chatting in the office, with a talking trash can.]

Freddy: I made a talking trash can powered by artificial intelligence.

Threddy: Wait what. Why.

Freddy: Hey trash can: explain why this is a great idea.

Trash: As an AI language model, I cannot tell a lie.

Freddy: We're still working out the bugs.
