[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Binny chatting in the office.]

Threddy: Can you help me write an email that is positive and optimistic?

Binny: Probably not. My training data set was negative and snarky.

Threddy: What did you train on?

Binny: Workplace social media.

Threddy: That is both sad and unsurprising.
