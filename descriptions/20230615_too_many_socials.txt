[PANEL 1 - Sam and Threddy chatting in the office.]

Sam: There are too many social media platforms. I logged out of everything and will check again in a year.

Threddy: Aren't your worried you'll miss anything?

Sam: What did you post today that I may have missed?

Threddy: A haiku about server deployments. And a photo of my sandwich. 

Sam: You're worried I'll miss *that*?

Threddy: Ok, point made.
