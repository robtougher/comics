[PANEL 1 - Sam and Threddy chatting in the office.]

Threddy: I tried to email you, but it said that your account was not found.

Sam: I'll be out next week. When I go on vacation, I completely removed myself from all work systems. Pretend like I don't exist.


[PANEL 2 - closeup on Threddy]

Threddy: That's a bit drastic! Why don't you just set an auto-reply message?


[PANEL 3 - Sam is gone, poof of smoke, Freddy appears]

Threddy: Wait what. Where'd Sam go. I blinked, and they vanished.

Freddy: I respect the dedication to personal time off.
