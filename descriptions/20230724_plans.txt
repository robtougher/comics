[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Sam chatting in the office.]

Threddy: What are your plans for today?

Sam: Well, to start I'm going to finish this latte. Then for lunch I might go out for a sandwich. 
In the afternoon Iâ€™ll probably grab an espresso and a pastry.

Threddy: I meant work plans, but that's ok too I guess.

Sam: Priorities, man.
