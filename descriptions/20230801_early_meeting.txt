[PANEL 1 - Sam and Threddy in the office. Sam is sitting down, looking at a laptop.]

Sam: I'm tired. I had to wake up outside of my work hours for a meeting.

Threddy: Yeah those morning meetings can be tough.

Sam: Morning? No, this one was at 1pm. 

Threddy: What are your daily work hours?

Sam: 2:30-4:15 PM. With a coffee break at 3:00.
