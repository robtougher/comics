[PANEL 1 - Freddy and Sam chatting in the office.]

Freddy: Our project is behind schedule. Can you work this weekend?

Sam: I'll be in another state. At a music festival. Without internet or cell access.

Freddy: So that's a no?

Sam: That's not just a no, it's absolutely fucking not. I'll be lucky if I remember my name this weekend.
