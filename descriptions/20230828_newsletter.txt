[PANEL 1 - Sam and Threddy in the office. Sam is sitting down, looking at a laptop.]

Sam: Freddy asked me to create a weekly team newsletter.

Threddy: That sees like a lot of work.

Sam: Not really. I'm using Chat-GPT to generate it.

Threddy: What's your AI prompt?

Sam: Create a team newsletter. The content doesn't matter because nobody will read it."
