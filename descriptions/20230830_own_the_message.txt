[PANEL 1 - Freddy and Threddy chatting in an office hallway.]

Freddy: During annual performance reviews, managers need to own the message and take responsibility for outcomes.

Threddy: It's hard to take responsibility when there are external factors like budget cuts and corporate mandates

Freddy: I don't make the rules, I just follow them.

Threddy: It's sound like you're not owning the message for those rules.

Freddy: Shit.
