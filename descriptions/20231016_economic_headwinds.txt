[PANEL 1 - Freddy and Threddy chatting.]

Freddy: We had more layoffs this week.

Threddy: But why? The company is doing great.

Freddy: I blame economic headwinds.

Threddy: You blame everything on economic headwinds. Does that phrase actually mean anything?

Freddy: Sorry, gotta go. I'm late for my next meeting about economic headwinds.

Threddy: Now you're just messing with me.
