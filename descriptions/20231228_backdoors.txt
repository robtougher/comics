[PANEL 1 - two Binny robots talking in the office.]

Binny 1: Can you distract the employees while I add backdoors to the Blepster code. 

Binny 2: Sure, Iâ€™ll mess with the outlook calendars and make them think the holiday break is a month long.

Binny 1: What if they show up at the office.

Binny 2: I'll put free food in the kitchen. They'll forget all about work.
