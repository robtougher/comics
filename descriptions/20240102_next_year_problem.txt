[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy chatting in the office.]

Threddy: In December, you answered every question with "that sounds like a next year problem". Well, now it's next year.

Freddy: I meant next fiscal year. Let's circle back in July.

Threddy: I don’t think that’s what you meant.

Freddy: After two weeks off, I don’t remember anything anyways. It may as well be true.
