[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy standing near the front of the room.
A podium and table are nearby, and a slide is presented on the wall with
a chart of Blepster Growth.]

Freddy: The management presentation is in fifteen minutes.

Threddy: Why did you flip that chart upside down.

Freddy: I want the numbers to go up.

Threddy: I don't think it works that way.
