[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Freddy chatting in the office.]

Freddy: I categorize my outlook meetings using colors. For example, green means "don't attend."

Threddy: That's really useful. What other colors do you use?

[PANEL 2 - closeup on Freddy.]

Freddy: No other colors. Just green. I don't attend anything.
