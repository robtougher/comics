[PANEL 1 - Threddy and Binny Robot chatting in the office. The background wall is orange.]

Threddy: Can you help me generate a list of five things I accomplished this week.

Binny: You ran a marathon, cured cancer, created time travel, saved the world, and won a nobel peace prize.

Threddy: None of those things are true.

Binny: I'm generative AI. Making things up is literally my job.
